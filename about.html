<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p> Hi, I'm Sammnyu Joshii
  I'm a Computer Science Engineer passionate about turning ideas into real-world solutions. I completed my B.Tech from Guru Tegh Bahadur Institute of Technology (GGSIPU) and did my schooling at Amity International School.
  
  I am deeply curious about how technology can solve meaningful problems, and I'm actively building my skills in web development, software engineering, and problem-solving. I believe in learning by doing, and I love creating things that are both functional and user-friendly.
  
  I am currently exploring new tools, building projects, and preparing myself to thrive in the tech industry. Whether it's through code or collaboration, I am always eager to take on challenges and learn something new.

<p> Outside of Tech
  Outside the world of tech, I am a sportsperson, an avid actor, a part-time singer, and an explorer at heart.
  
  I love playing cricket and basketball—sports have always been my go-to way to disconnect from stress and simply enjoy the moment. I also enjoy working out, and overall, I make it a priority to stay fit and active.
  
  As the saying goes, “Health is Wealth”—and I truly believe that maintaining good physical and mental health is essential for living a balanced and fulfilling life.

<p>  My Philosophy
  I am someone who believes that life is a continuous battle—a war that must be fought every single day. Ups and downs are inevitable, but what truly matters is the zeal to keep moving, the perseverance, and the fortitude to rise each time you fall.
  
  In the end, the world rarely sees your effort. It only sees whether you succeeded or failed, and often judges you solely on that. That is why it is important to remember: this is your war, and you're fighting it alone.
  
  Because when you're at your lowest, no relationship or connection can truly pull you out of the darkness unless you choose to rise yourself.
  
  To conclude,
  your attitude should be:
  
  SOME WISH FOR IT. WE WORK FOR IT.</p>
